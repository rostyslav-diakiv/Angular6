# Angular6

To be able to use Web client you should download the latest version of Web API project:

## Web API project
 - Download Airport WEB API project, branch: Async-feature from:
 - https://github.com/rostyslav-diakiv/Airport/tree/Async-feature
 - Use Kestrel as a web server, or if you want use IIS, change the configuration(url) of Web Client in: enviroment.development.ts

## Web client project
how to run:
  - npm install

 Not all views have the same layout, template because I wanted to use different approaches to complete the task and learn more Angular features
